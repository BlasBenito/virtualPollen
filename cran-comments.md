## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. The previous submission was rejected with the comment:

"Thanks, if there are references describing the methods in your package,
please add these in the Description field of your DESCRIPTION file in
the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:' and angle brackets for auto-linking."

However, there are no references that must be in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file, this is an original work, not a reimplementation of someone else's algorithms.
