Title: Simulating pollen curves from virtual taxa with different life and niche traits
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Blas M. Benito
Maintainer: Blas M. Benito <blasbenito@gmail.com>
Description: Tools to generate virtual environmental drivers with a given temporal autocorrelation, and to simulate pollen curves at annual resolution over millennial time-scales based on these drivers and virtual taxa with different life traits and niche features. It also provides the means to simulate cuasi-realistic pollen-data conditions by applying simulated accumulation rates and given depth intervals between consecutive samples.
