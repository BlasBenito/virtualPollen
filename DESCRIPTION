Title: Simulating Pollen Curves from Virtual Taxa with Different Life and Niche Traits
Version: 1.0.2
Authors@R: person(given="Blas M.", family="Benito", email="blasbenito@gmail.com", role=c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Tools to generate virtual environmental drivers with a given temporal autocorrelation, and to simulate pollen curves at annual resolution over millennial time-scales based on these drivers and virtual taxa with different life traits and niche features. It also provides the means to simulate quasi-realistic pollen-data conditions by applying simulated accumulation rates and given depth intervals between consecutive samples.
