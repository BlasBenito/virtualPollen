Title: Generation of virtual pollen curves
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Blas M. Benito
Maintainer: Blas M. Benito <blasbenito@gmail.com>
Description: Provides tools to simulate pollen curves of annual resolution based on virtual taxa with different traits (life-span, fecundity, growth-rate, niche position and niche breadth) by using a simple individual-based model. It also provides the mean to generate a virtual sediment accumulation rate to aggregate simulated pollen curves into centimetres, to represent taphonomical processes.
